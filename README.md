[Simon Game](https://assugeni.github.io/milestone-simon/) is a very popular memory game dating back as far as 1978, invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The logic of the game was to be written with JavaScript. The gameâ€™s aesthetics were to be done using the conventional HTML/CSS technologies.

### What it does

Simon plays a randomly generated sequence for the player to repeat using colours and tones. The player has the sole goal of repeating the same sequence as Simon to win the game. The sequence will get longer and longer as the player progresses to higher levels.

### Player Experience

- Players immediately experience a clear, easy and intuitive feel for the game right away. Simple controls which allow the player to have an easy understanding of how to play the game. 
- Should the player be confused at any point, a 'Game-Info' box has been provided to give an informative description of what features the game has to offer.

- Inviting sounds & bright colours have been added to each pad to give the player a clear distinction between each pad.
